            <p> Family is the cornerstone of the society. With specific
                reference to Hong Kong, there are several sources
                of the influence which affect family development.
                Primarily, as a Chinese society, Hong Kong families
                are under the influence of traditional Chinese cultural
                beliefs, although the related impact has gradually
                weakened. In the traditional Chinese culture, families
                showed several characteristics. First, male members
                generally held a superior position whereas females
                typically occupied a submissive role. Second, under
                the strong influence of Confucianism, filial piety was
                strongly upheld with a central focus on the father-son
                relationship. Third, because of the importance of
                maintaining harmony in the family, the collective
                interest (i.e., family interest) was placed above
                individual interest.</p>

            <p>The family unit is a very important aspect of Venezuelan culture. Venezuelan families are generally
                tight-knit, close and supportive, providing an economic and social safety-net. Extended family ties play
                a particularly large role in outer-urban regions and rural areas. Meet Gabriella, who takes us through

            <p>In Cameroon, child bearing is highly valued and beliefs and practices concerning child rearing vary by
                ethnic group. However certain values are commonly held by the ethnic groups. These values include the
                importance that the Cameroonians attach to learning by example and learning through play. They also
                attribute importance to observational learning by teaching their children to observe and imitate tasks
                performed by adults. It has been reported that the dominant family pattern in Cameroon is the
                patrilineal and extended or joint family . This family pattern promotes interdependence, and the culture
                of the society is collectivistic and communal in orientatio.</p>

            <p>Many of us have seen pictures of African women carrying babies low on their back in a cloth wrapped
                around their torsos. But a discussion of cultural babywearing must look across many different cultures
                in Africa as there are different styles of cloth and different ways of wearing. In Kenya, babies are
                often wrapped on a wearer's back or hip in a traditional kanga cloth; the fabric is spread over one
                shoulder and under the other and tied in front in a traditional sling carry pattern, Here are some ways:

                <h1>Your baby has a dirty nappy</h1>

                Babies cry a lot in their first few months. There are many types of baby cries, but your baby will let
                you
                know when they have a wet or full nappy. A wet or dirty nappy is one of the top reasons babies are
                uncomfortable. No one wants to wear a full nappy for longer than they have to.

                Listen for: A whiny, nasal, persistent cry with a short cry sound followed by a longer one. As the
                sounds
                turn into intense crying, it is a signal that the baby has had enough. Check to see if they have a full
                or
                dirty nappy.
            </li>

            <li>
                <h1>Your baby is hungry</h1>

                This type of cry relates to breastfed babies and bottle-fed babies. It can have a slow introductory
                stage
                where a baby is waking and realizing they're hungry. At first, it might sound like fussy crying, but
                after a
                while, the cries become more frantic to a point where they are louder, longer and more demanding.

                Listen for: A type of cry that sounds like a siren. The sound is often accompanied by putting the hand
                to
                the mouth, clenching fingers and turning their head towards the bottle or breast.
            </li>
            <li>
                <h1>You have a tired baby</h1>

                Babies cry to communicate with their parents. For example, they may cry because they're hungry,
                uncomfortable or
                tired. Cindy Davenport from Safe Sleep Space, a Petit ELJ partner and sector expert, advises families to
                “look,
                listen and think about what might be going on”. Then, respond to a baby's cues.

                During the first few weeks, newborn babies rely primarily on their cry and reflexes to communicate. So
                you
                might
                notice them yawning, closing their eyes, making jerky movements, putting their fist to their mouth and
                sucking
                on their thumb. An older baby may rub their eyes as they develop.

                Listen for: High pitched crying baby sounds that have a lot of breath behind them. They often begin as
                short
                soft whimpers that increase in intensity until the child's needs are met. This is a cry that your
                natural
                senses
                will tune into and learn.
            </li>
            <li>
                <h1>You have a sick baby</h1>

                This cry can be tough for parents of babies and carers to hear, but it usually signifies that your
                little
                one is
                not feeling well. You should also consider other symptoms like whether your baby is lethargic, whether
                their
                eyes are watery, or they have a runny or blocked nose.

                Take your chils temperature if you're worried they have a fever. Call your GP or state-based helpline
                if
                you
                are concerned about their health and wellbeing. If you suspect your baby has acid reflux (GER), tell
                your
                doctor.

                Listen for: Constant crying that doesn't stop even when the baby is fed, comforted or sleeping. Cries
                that
                indicate signs of illness often sound like weak, tired moans. They are usually high pitched with low
                intensity.
                There may also be long pauses between crying sessions.
            </li>
            <li>
                <h1>Your baby is uncomfortable</h1>

                This type of cry can happen anytime, especially with older babies who have more mobility. Put simply,
                your
                baby is not where they want to be. They might wriggle a lot in your arms, turn their head from one side
                to
                the other or reach towards where they want to go.

                Listen for: A cry that is more like a combination of all the cries put together. It can be persistent
                until
                the baby gets what they want. Sometimes they might want to be put down. Other times they may want to be
                picked up and held or cuddled by a different person.
            </li>
